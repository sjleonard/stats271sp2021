# Final project

The final project is an opportunity to apply what you've learned throughout the course to a problem that interests you. Unlike the homeworks, you don't need to implement everything from scratch. You can use existing packages like Stan, TFP, etc. to help construct and perform inference in your model.

The project will consist of:
- Approx. 5pg report with figures and references, or (7-8pg report if working in a team of two). The paper should include intro, background/related work, model, algorithm, results, conclusion. Think of it like a workshop paper for a stat/ML conference.
- A Jupyter notebook with your code, just like for the homeworks. If it doesn't fit in a single notebook, just give us a Github link.
- A virtual poster presentation on the last day of class, June 2nd. (More info coming soon, but Iâ€™m hoping to use GatherTown.) Your "poster" will be 1-3 slides that you'll present via screenshare in GatherTown.

To give you a sense of what we're expecting:
- A **great** project would involve constructing of a model---one that synthesizes and goes beyond the various ideas from lecture and homework---tailored to your particular dataset and careful thought about how to perform Bayesian inference. It would involve a variety of analyses to check your model and justify your interpretation of the results. The presentation would clearly and concisely convey your results. 
- An **okay** project would tweak a model, algorithm, and analysis from class and apply it to a new dataset. It would involve a few different checks to show that the model is appropriate and a nice report of your findings. The presentation would get the message across. 
- A **subpar** project would simply apply existing techniques from scikit learn, Stan tutorials, etc. to a dataset and do the bare minimum to get a result. It might omit key steps of model checking and model criticism or have clear conceptual errors in the model and/or algorithm formulation. The presentation might be perfunctory.

We're not grading on a strict curve. We hope you all submit great projects!
